# Smart_Fit_Ai
SmartFit AI is an Angular-based web app that acts as a virtual tailor. It uses a simulated camera-scan to estimate body measurements and recommend clothing sizes. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Angular Signals, it supports multi-user profiles, scan history, dashboards, and a clean, responsive UI.
